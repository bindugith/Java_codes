Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array. Note: An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. Also, the rightmost element is always a leader.

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 107 0 <= Ai <= 107

Output Format

Print all the leaders.

Sample Input 0

6
16 17 4 3 5 2
Sample Output 0

17 5 2
Explanation 0

Testcase 3: All elements on the right of 7 (at index 0) are smaller than or equal to 7. Also, all the elements of right side of 7 (at index 3) are smaller than 7. And, the last element 3 is itself a leader since no elements are on its right.
